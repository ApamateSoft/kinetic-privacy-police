# Kinetic Privacy Policy
**Effective Date:** June 5, 2025

This policy explains how the Kinetic mobile application handles your information. Kinetic is an Android application 
developed by Jesús Alberto Mendoza Sánchez under the ApamateSoft brand, which uses the device's GPS to display your 
real-time travel speed.

## 1. Information We Collect
### 1.1 Current Version
- **Real-time location data:** We use your device's GPS <u>exclusively</u> to calculate and display your current speed. 
This data is not stored, shared, or transmitted to external servers.
- **Personal data:** We do not collect names, email addresses, device identifiers, or other personal information.

## 1.2 Future Features (Planned)
- **Route history:** In the future, we plan to store locally your routes, speeds, altitude, and travel times.
- **Advertising:** We may integrate ad services (e.g., AdMob) that collect anonymous data to personalize ads.
- **Pro Version:** For in-app purchases, we plan to collect the necessary information to preserve your purchases.

## 2. Purpose of Data Processing
Currently, we use GPS data solely to:
- Calculate and display your speed in real-time.
- Provide the basic functionality of the application.

## 3. Legal Basis (GDPR/LGPD)
For users in the EU and Brazil:
- **Performance of a contract:** The processing is necessary to provide the basic functionality of the application.
- **Consent:** For future features such as route history or advertising, we will request your explicit consent.

## 4. User Rights

- **Access:** Request information about your data.
- **Erasure (Deletion):** Ask us to delete your data.

## 5. Information Sharing
**Current version:** We do not share any data with third parties.
**Future updates:** If we integrate:
- **Analytics:** We will use services like Firebase (Google) for anonymous statistics.
- **Advertising:** We will use networks like AdMob (Google) that collect anonymous data.
- **Storage:** There are no plans to store route history data in the cloud; storage will be handled completely locally on your device.

## 6. Data Security
We implement technical measures such as:
- Secure local storage on your device.
- Data collection minimization.
- Regular security updates.

## 7. Children's Privacy
Kinetic is not intended for children under the age of 13 (or the applicable minimum age in your jurisdiction, such as 16
for certain processing under GDPR). We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children. If 
you become aware that a child has provided us with personal information without parental consent, please contact us. If 
we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child without verification of parental consent, we 
will take steps to remove that information from our servers (if future features involving server storage be 
implemented).
